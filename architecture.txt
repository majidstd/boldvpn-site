so with all information that you worked on, let me give you to see your view for building a global vpn platform.
now, let me tell what is all about. I am trying to build a comapany to sell commercial vpn service across the globe for censorship and those country block
     people for free internet. I am suing opnsense for vpn solution using wireguard and for authentication when a user connects then captive portal asking for
     login. to implement this we deployed a freebsd for this and deploy radiusd-psql to use it for radius and database. also, we build api server via node to
     handle the backend api call. so, people when connected to vpn, captiveportal template will show them on https://login.boldvpn.net:8000 or redirect it to
     this for login. in OPNsense, we used HAproxy to handle the api call to bsd. opnsense handles 443 and 80 traffic and use backend http talk to freebsd as it
     is local and private network. Also, from internet people they can login to check their connect detail and etc. so, the plan is to build a complete solutio
     at the moment, we are using wireguard mobile app, later we want to build a mobile app to have our own complete solution. any improvement or suggestion for
     success or another other solution to achieve and make massiv money, please help for better security and making money globally. Also, tell me your architecture and security and business plan
